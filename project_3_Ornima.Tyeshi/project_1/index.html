Seeing the garden in full bloom with its 150 million flowers arranged in colourful arches and patterns, and the myriad shapes they form, is truly magnificent.

<h3> <b> <u>Reviews</u> </b> </h3>

  <dt> <b>Dubai-great place for kids</b> </dt>
  <dd>Me and my 6 yr old granddaughter traveled from Arkansas to meet up with her dad in Dubai since he could easily get there from his job in Iraq. With great trepidation, I finally gave in and ended up having a great time. This is a wonderful city for children. So much to see and do with a little research on what is offered at all the different malls, water parks, etc... We spent 10 days there and stayed at the Le Meridien Mina Seyahi which I recommend if you love pools and water sports. My only complaint was it was far from a metro stop and some of the taxi drivers didn't seem to be very familiar with it. We went on a dessert safari which was fantastic. Also went to both the Wild Wadi waterpark and the Aquaventure at the Atlantis. The malls are fabulous for just walking around. The last day we went to the Dubai Ski area. Highly recommend this as a family vacation spot.</dd>
<br>
<dt> <b>Shop till you drop</b> </dt>
<dd>If you enjoy shopping and have lots of money to spend then you will be in your element in the shopping mals. All the designers you could ask for are located in these stunning, luxury shopping havens. For those of you on a tighter budget there are options to grab yourself an amazing designer fake from one of the stores at Karama and similar souks. It is difficult to tell the difference between some of the bags at Karama and the real ones you'll find in Mulberry and Gucci in the mall.</dd>
